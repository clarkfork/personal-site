That includes hosting, unlimited edits, 24/7 support, lifetime updates, analytics, help with your Google Profile, and I basically do everything so my clients never have to. I do this because it releases the financial stress on my clients, they know exactly what their website costs them, and I act as their personal website developer that is ready at any moment to take their call and offer my expertise.",
