# Clark Fork Web Designs

## Business Plan

### What I Do

I do things a little different, I charge $0 down and $50 a month. That includes hosting, unlimited edits, 24/7 support, lifetime updates, analytics, help with your Google Profile, and I basically do everything so my clients never have to. I do this because it releases the financial stress on my clients, they know exactly what their website costs them, and I act as their personal website developer that is ready at any moment to take their call and offer my expertise.

### Principles

- Outwork your inexperience.
- Make it a no-brainer so that it would be stupid not to work with me.
- “A man without a vision for his future always returns to his past.”
- “My unmatched perspicacity coupled with my sheer indefatigability makes me a feared opponent in any realm of human endeavor.”
- “Success is not the result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.”

## My Services

### Web Design & Development ($50/mo) (will be increased to $60/mo)
- Custom Website Design
- Hosting
- Unlimited Edits
- 24/7 Support
- Lifetime Updates
- Analytics
- Google Profile Management

I custom code everything from scratch. This already makes my websites better, because my sites load quicker and make google happier. When I build a site for a client, they always rank 98-100 across all metrics and are literally as fast as they can be. Over time, this makes my websites more favorable to the search algorithms, and my client's sites will rank higher than their competitors who are using crappy wordpress websites. I also build my websites in a specific structure - there’s a specific way to place your content, and how to write about it, that funnels visitors into a sale. These are called website conversion funnels, and I use them to design more effective websites. You can’t just throw code and words together and expect it to bring you business - everything has to be calculated and purposeful, and that’s the ultimate difference between me and all the other website companies.

A quality website matters. While the quality of work and positive reviews are essential for a business, a well-crafted website enhances their impact exponentially. A landscaping client of mine with great services and a five-star Google review had a dramatic increase in form submissions with his Clarkfork website, and that was a massive opportunity for him. A good website absolutely matters.

If a client wants to just pay lump-sum, I can do that. Maybe charge $1000-$2000 and also try to sell a monthly retainer thing.

### Website + Google Ads Management ($100/mo) (will be increased to $120/mo)
- All Website Services
- Campaign Strategy and Setup
- Ad Copywriting and Design
- Tracking and Reporting
- Ongoing Optimization

I craft each campaign to maximize results. By customizing every aspect of the campaign, from keyword selection to copywriting, clients can expect their ads to consistently bring their Clarkfork website to the top of google, driving targeted traffic to their websites at an efficient PPC cost. Combined with the Clarkfork Website, visitors are guided through strategically designed funnels that lead them to take action. This cohesive approach ensures that every click translates into an optimal ROI, which drives the best results for my clients.

### Why pay me every month?

Because I handle everything. My clients never have to fiddle with a website or fix something that broke. They never have to add content or get frustrated over SEO. At the end of the month, I am confident that the website brought in more than $50 in value to the business, and I am consistently delivering value far beyond the clients’ investment. I'm here when my clients need me, and I'm allowing them to focus on what they're good at, which is running their business. I’m selling a relationship, not just a website. And with that relationship comes peace of mind. 

For most of my clients (small blue-collar businesses), a new client can bring them thousands of dollars (whether immediately, like for painting, or over a few years, like lawn care).

If the website is bringing them at least one new client per month, it more than pays for itself. Now imagine it brings in 2 or 3 or more clients per month. My clients spend $50 per month, and my services bring them much more. It's an asset of their business.

## How We Operate

### Our Process

Clark Fork Web Designs follows a process that keeps things simple for our clients

1. **Onboarding:** We send a google doc that provides us info about their business
2. **Design:** We design your site beforehand so you can review before development
3. **Development:** We code your site and provide you with demo links to review
4. **Deployment:** We setup NS records, and deploy the site to the web
5. **Maintenance:** We always maintain and keep analytics of your site

Some clients might want to see all design aspects before coding, and some just want me to do it all. Ask beforehand.
Depending on what registrar they use (or if they have one) I might need to go on google meet to screenshare and help them change NS records.

Trust can only get you so far. My clients have assurance that they are the owners of the domain, and can setup with another website anytime.
My clients keep ownership of their domain (unless they want me to own it). I keep ownership of my code (as stated in the onboarding doc).

## Strategy

### Client Aquisition

I use a "permissionless" strategy to get my clients. It sounds bad, but it works. 

Most people ask, “How can I help you?” or “What can I do to work with you?”. This is making them do more work to figure out if I'm any good.

Instead, I just show them why they should work with me. I show them that I've done my homework, and I know what I'm doing. Make it stupid for someone to not work with me.

This isn't free work. It's pre-work. I just have to put in some effort before I reach out.

Best case? I impress the client, and start getting paid every month.

Worst case? I got more experience and can change the site so it fits another company.

All I have to do is spend time finding a really quality company that I want to work with. Then I can do my research and make a professional site for them. Then I can reach out, show them that I already put the work in, and see what they think.

### Build Strategy

I'll design and build a professional and quality website template for a specific profession (ex. lawn care, painting, etc.). Have a file and a github repo specifically for this template (Ex. Landscaper 001)

Once I have the template to look at, I will make a program that will resize photos to the exact specifications that I need. Then, I can just drag and drop all my images, and I'll have all my site images ready in seconds.

I can use each template for multiple clients. I'll find multiple quality candidates across the US (spread out), and will build out the template to match their business. If they are spread out, I will have 8-12 clients per template.

### The Math

It will take me about 10 hours to build the template and the email program (one day).

Then I can build out about 8 company sites per day from that template. I will call them right after I have made the template (so 8 calls per day). 

Assuming that 8 custom sites using my 'permissionless' strategy will get me a client, I have already got myself a client.

Then I can continue using that template for different companies until I get to 8-12 clients, and then I can make a new template.

Assuming that I will have an average of 10 clients per template, and my average payment might be $75/mo, each template should bring me around $750/mo
